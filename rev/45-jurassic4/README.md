## Problem Statement
With a t-rex on the loose, you need to stop it! Luckily, you remember a trap that you previously set to stop any dinosaur in their tracks. You run to the trap, and you realize that it needs a passphrase to use. Luckily, you also have access to the trap's source code.

Quick, get the passphrase before it's too late!
