## Problem Statement
It's been a long day at the park. You are heading home, but before you can exit, you meet the legendary gatekeeper, dinosauce313. dinosauce313 asks you what the best dinosaur is (hint: contrary to what some may believe, it's not a T-Rex!), but he wants the answer given as a flag. 

Can you tell dinosauce313 what he wants to hear, and exit the park?
