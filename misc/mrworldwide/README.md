## Problem Statement
Mr. Worldwide is planning a trip around the world! He needs to make a website, and is uploading an image to it. However, he suspects that the image file holds a secret message. What is the message? Make sure that the flag is in the format `flag{}`.

## Solution
Put the image 

Each color value can be converted into an ASCII character. For example, rgb(102,108,97) has three decimal values (102, 108, and 97) which each convert to a text character (f, l, and a). Repeating this for the rest of the colors, we get `flag{colors_are_data}`.

## Flag
`flag{colors_are_data}`
